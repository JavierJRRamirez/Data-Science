Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/chrisketelsen/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).  \n\n**NOTES**: \n\n- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API please do not change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code.\n- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. "

In a penalty shootout, each team takes turns attempting 5 shots on the goal from the penalty mark that are defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper, with the team that makes more successful kicks being declared the winner of the match.  If after 5 shots the score is still tied, the game enters _sudden death_ and the teams continue to take 1 shot each until one team scores and the other does not. \n\nSuppose that two teams ( Team $A$ and Team $B~$) are still tied at the end of the first round of 5 penalty shots and are entering sudden death.  Each team will now take one shot each in an attempt to win.  Suppose that the result of one shot is independent of the other shots, Team $A$ makes their shot with probability $p$, and Team $B$ makes their shot with probability $q$.  Let $W$ be the event that \"Team $A$ wins the game\", $E$ be the event that \"the game ends after the first round of sudden death penalty shots\", and $T$ be the event that \"the game is still tied after the first round of sudden death penalty shots\". \n\n**Part A**: The shootout continues until Team $A$ or Team $B$ wins.

Among the games they play a lot are Miniopoly and a similar game with slightly tweaked rules called **Fakeiopoly!**  Being Data-Nerds, they like to record the details of each game they play for future analysis.  Since the games are similar, they store the results for Miniopoly and Fakeiopoly in the same database.  Unfortunately, their data has been corrupted!  The only data that survived are the states (i.e. square numbers) they were on after each of the first 20 turns as well a the amount of cash they had on hand after each of the first 20 turns. This information is stored in the columns **S1**-**S20** and **C1**-**C20** in the following DataFrame. "

Your job is to see if you can reconstruct the missing **Game** labels in the second half of the DataFrame.  \n\nSadly, Fakeiopoly was a game of their own invention, and the rules were among the lost data.  But, being budding data scientists, you can probably glean some insights into the non-standard rules by exploring the data with intact labels in the first half of the DataFrame. \n\n**Part A**: Complete the function predict_game_log below to predict whether each game in the DataFrame is real or fake.  To help you, we've provided a score function that reports the accuracy of your predictions on the rows that have intact labels.  \n\nOK, here are the **rules**: \n\n- You may **NOT** load any external libraries beyond Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.  Instead of fancy Machine Learning techniques you may have picked up on the streets, you'll have to rely on your probability, heuristics, and exploratory data analysis skills. \n- You may write any additional functions you like, but you should **NOT** change the way that predict_game_log is called or what it returns. \n\nAnd some final **guidance**: \n\n- While we hope you do well, and obtain great accuracies, we're more interested in seeing how you approach the problem.  As part of your solution you should describe in detail how you based your predictions.  A solution with high accuracy and no justification of you approach may receive a low score, while a solution with mediocre accuracy and good justification may receive a high score.  What aspects of the data lead you to believe that your approach might be successful? Supporting evidence might include graphical summaries of the data and extensive description of trial and error. "

Challenge Problems never need to be turned in (and in fact, will not be graded) but we encourage you to give them a shot (after completing the required homework problems) and discuss them with your classmates and your instructors. \n\nThe following Challenge Problem was a [Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) on [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com) a few years back. \n\nYou’re on the north shore of a river, and want to cross to the south, via a series of 13 bridges and six islands, which you can see in the diagram below. But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n\n<br>\n\n![alt text](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/roeder-riddler-diagram-11.png?w=575&h=449&quality=90&strip=info)\n\n<br>\n\nWhat’s the probability you will be able to cross the river in the morning? (You have no boat, can’t swim, can’t fix the bridges, etc. No tricks.)"
